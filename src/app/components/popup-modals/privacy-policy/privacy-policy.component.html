    Heyo!
    <br>
    LIQUID and csideinn.de collects NO INFORMATION AT ALL, neither about you, nor your pets, nor your grandmother.
    HOWEVER, since the company hosting the server behind csideinn.de has to adhere to laws and stuff, they have to
    log some non-anonymous information about you, most importantly your IP if I'm not mistaken.
    Now for SOME GREAT and LOGICAL reason <b>I</b> seem to be the one responsible for telling you about this, so just to be
    safe, here is a generic privacy policy I took from <a
      href="privacypolicygenerator.org">privacypolicygenerator.org</a>. It's pretty shit, not even properly acknowledging
    that this website uses neither cookies nor any Ad-Networks et cetera, but I'm not going to touch it. Better to be
    safe. Don't wanna contract beurocratitis or lawyosis.</b>
